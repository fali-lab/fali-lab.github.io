Our lab examines how human activities and climate change affect climate hazards (e.g., wildfires, droughts) and natural ecosystems (e.g., forests and wetlands), and how to better monitor, predict, and mitigate the negative effects. We leverage advances in AI (e.g., Causality Inference, physics-informed AI), Earth system models, and big data (e.g., remote sensing/GIS, eddy covariance), to understand and model the fundamental processes shaping our socio-ecological systems. 

PhD Opportunities (updated Sep. 2025) 
======
We are seeking three fully-funded Ph.D. students (tuition and stipend) to start in the **Fall of 2026**. Students interested in the following topics are encouraged to apply:
- AI: Machine learning, causality inference
- Data science: Remote sensing, geospatial data science and modeling
- Environmental or Earth system science: human-environment interactions, climate hazard/risk modeling, vegetation dynamics, land-atmosphere interactions of carbon, water, and energy
- We also encourage research directions beyond those listed, but within the lab’s overall research umbrella.
**Applicants must meet the [UT Austin Graduate school's admission requirements](https://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/admission/graduate-admission/)**

**How to apply**: Please send your cover letter, most recent CV, and contact information of three references to Fa Li at fa.li@austin.utexas.edu (cc: fali2@stanford.edu), using “PhD Application for Land Intelligence Lab” as the subject line of the email. We sincerely appreciate all applications; only shortlisted candidates will be contacted for an interview. 

**For full consideration, applications should be received by November 10, 2025**.

Postdoc Opportunities
======
Applicants are expected to apply for the University’s internal or external fellowships. For more information on fellowship and funding opportunities, please contact Fa Li (fa.li@austin.utexas.edu)
