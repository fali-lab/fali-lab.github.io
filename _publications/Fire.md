Wildfires are increasing in frequency, intensity, and size across many parts of the world, including North America, Europe, Oceania, and Southeast Asia. A reliable way to predict, monitor, and mitigate fire risk and impacts is indispensable.  

Our group aims to better:  
- Monitor and understand fire dynamics, including controls from hydroclimate, vegetation dynamcis, and human activities  
- Model fires using AI and satellite data, including probability, risk, and behavior changes 
- Quantify post-fire impacts on humans and ecosystems
